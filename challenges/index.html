	<h1>Challenges</h1>
	
	<p>
		Here you can find challenges from Hack the Box. There are currently 10 different types of challenges: reversing, crypto, stego, Pwn, Web, Misc, Forensics, Mobile, OSINT and hardware.<br>
    I find that challenges are a good way to improve one's skills in a particular field.

  <h2>Stego</h2>

	<p>Steganography is the art of hiding information in different types of medias. It's a very old practice, and invisible ink is an example of how it was used. 
		Nowadays, stego is used to hide message inside digital images or other media files.</p>

  <h2>OSINT</h2>

	<p>OSINT stands for Open Source Intelligence. It is information collected from public sources such as the internet (social networks, ...).
They are very interesting challenges because it is widely used in cybersecurity.</p>
