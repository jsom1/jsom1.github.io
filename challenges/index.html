	<h1>Challenges</h1>
	
	<p>
		Here you can find challenges from Hack the Box. There are currently 10 different types of challenges: reversing, crypto, stego, Pwn, Web, Misc, Forensics, Mobile, OSINT and hardware.<br>
    I find that challenges are a good way to improve one's skills in a particular field.

  <h2>Stego</h2>

	<p>Steganography is the art of hiding information in different types of medias. It's a very old practice, and invisible ink is an example of how it was used. 
		Nowadays, stego is used to hide message inside digital images or other media files.</p>
