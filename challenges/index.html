	<h1>Challenges</h1>
	
	<p>
		This page is dedicated to Hack The Box challenges. There are currently 10 different types of challenges: reversing, crypto, stego, Pwn, Web, Misc, Forensics, Mobile, OSINT and hardware.<br>
    I find that challenges are a good way to improve one's skills in a particular field.

  <h2>Misc</h2>
	
	<p>As its name indicates, this category regroups challenges that didn't really belong to any specific category.</p>

	</ul>

  <h2>Stego</h2>

	<p>Steganography is the art of hiding information in different types of medias. It's a very old practice, and invisible ink is an example of how it was used. 
		Nowadays, stego is used to hide message inside digital images or other media files.</p>

  <h2>OSINT</h2>

	<p>OSINT stands for Open Source Intelligence. It is information collected from public sources such as the internet (social networks, ...).
They are very interesting challenges because it is widely used in cybersecurity.</p>

  <h2>Crypto</h2>

	<p>Cryptography is associated with the process of converting ordinary plain text into unintelligible text and vice-versa. 
		It is a method of storing and transmitting data in a particular form so that only those for whom it is intended can read and process it.
It is used in many applications like banking transactions cards, computer passwords, and e- commerce transactions. 
		There are 3 main types of cryptography: Symmetric-key Cryptography, Public-Key Cryptography and Hash Functions.</p>
