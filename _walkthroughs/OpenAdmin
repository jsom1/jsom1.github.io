# OpenAdmin

 <div id="boxinfo">
 <div id="textbox">
 <p class="alignleft">**Difficulty**: easy</p>
 <p class="aligncenter">**Type**: CTF</p>
 <p class="alignright">**OS**: Linux</p>
 </div>
 <div style="clear: both;"></div>
 </div> 

<ins>**Lab configuration**</ins>


First, download VirtualBox and Kali (or Parrot). When the machine is imported in VirtualBox, chose *bridged adapter* in the Network tab to have access to the internet. Start and set up the machine as you like.

*OpenAdmin* is a retired box of Hack The Box, and it is necessary to get a **VIP access** in order to do it (10$/month). Then, it's super easy and convenient to connect to it. The first thing to do is to download the connection pack at <https://www.hackthebox.eu/home/htb/access>. Then, open a terminal (make sure you're in the same directory as your connection file (*yourname*.ovpn)) and type the following command:

~~~~
openvpn yourname.ovpn
~~~~~

Where *yourname* is your username on Hack The Box. 
If you're using **Kali 2020**, make sure to add **sudo** to the previous command.

When this is done, just look at the IP of the machine on HTB (Hack the Box). *OpenAdmin* is given the IP 10.10.10.171.\\
We're ready to start !
