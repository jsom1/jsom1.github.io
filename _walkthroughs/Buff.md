<ins>**Lab configuration**</ins>

First, download VirtualBox and Kali (or Parrot). When the machine is imported in VirtualBox, chose *bridged adapter* in the Network tab to have access to the internet. Start and set up the machine as you like.

*Buff* is a retired box of Hack The Box, and it is necessary to get a **VIP access** in order to do it (10$/month). Then, it's super easy and convenient to connect to it. The first thing to do is to download the connection pack at <https://www.hackthebox.eu/home/htb/access>. Then, open a terminal (make sure you're in the same directory as your connection file (*yourname*.ovpn)) and type the following command:

~~~~
openvpn yourname.ovpn
~~~~~

Where *yourname* is your username on Hack The Box. 
If you're using **Kali 2020**, make sure to add **sudo** to the previous command.

When this is done, just look at the IP of the machine on HTB (Hack the Box). *Buff* is given the IP 10.10.10.198.\\
We're ready to start !

## 1. Scan the ports of the target

Let's start by performing the usual nmap scan with the flags *-sV* to have a verbose output and *-sC* to enable the most common scripts scan.
