Import the VMs in VirtualBox.

For each of the VMs, go in settings in VirtualBox -->  network and select Host-only Adapter (the name should appear by default. If it does not, create one from the initial menu: File --> Host Network Manager --> create).

With this configuration, the VMs are isolated on a network.

It is also possible to set both VMs in bridged adapter, and add a second interface for the Kali machine with NAT (so that kali can access the internet).
