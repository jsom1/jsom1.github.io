# Basic Pentesting: 1

**Difficulty**: beginner\\
**Type** : boot2root\\
**Objective** : gain root access

**Lab configuration**\\

1. Download the box:\\

2. Download Kali Linux (if you don't have it already):\\

3. Import both VMs in VirtualBox. For each of them, go in settings -> network and select Host-only Adapter (the name should appear by default. If it does not, create one from the initial menu: File -> Host Network Manager -> create).
With this configuration, the VMs are isolated on a network.
It is also possible to set both VMs in bridged adapter, and add a second interface for the Kali machine with NAT (so that kali can access the internet).

Let's get started!

## Find the victim's IP address

First, we turn on the 2 VMs. We can't connect to the target machine, because we don't know the credentials. The purpose will be to gain root access on this machine.

Sometimes, the IP address of the target is given on the start-up screen, but it is rarely the case.
