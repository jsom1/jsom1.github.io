	<h2>Why am I doing this</h2>
	<p>
	Until recently, I had been thinking about shifting my career path towards cybersecurity for a while.<br>
	When I decided to learn more about the topic, I didn't really know where to start. I had very basic knowledge 
	of how networks work, but I didn't know much about hacking.<br>
	I started with courses on <a href="https://www.coursera.org/">Coursera</a>, but I didn't
	get what I was expecting. It was very theoretical and I needed hands-on experience. Like 
	many others, I learn best by doing...
	</p>
	
	<p>
	After some research, I found Vulnhub and Hack The Box. I also looked for serious certifications that could help
	me finding a job someday and found those of Offensive Security. Finally, I bought some good books and found
	freee courses on <a href="https://www.cybrary.it/">Cybrary</a>...<br>
	I had everything I needed to start : a goal, hands-on exercises, and a ton of things to learn from the books and
	courses.<br>
	I started taking notes about the books and documented what I was doing in the boxes. I was doing it in Google drive,
	when I suddenly thought about regrouping everything in one place that would serve one purpose : telling my journey.
	Bonus, I would get introduced to HTML and be able to share my experience with anyone that would be interested.
