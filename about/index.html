	<!--<h2>Why am I doing this</h2>-->
	<p>
	When I decided to learn more about cybersecurity, I didn't really know where to start. I had very basic knowledge 
	of how networks work, and I didn't know much about hacking...<br>
	I started with courses on <a href="https://www.coursera.org/" target="_blank">Coursera</a>, but I didn't
	get what I was expecting: it was very theoretical and I needed hands-on experience.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	After some research, I found <a href="https://www.vulnhub.com/" target="_blank">Vulnhub</a> and <a href="https://www.hackthebox.eu/" target="_blank">Hack The Box</a>. I also looked for serious certifications
	and found those of <a href="https://www.offensive-security.com/" target="_blank">Offensive Security</a> (the developers of Kali Linux). Finally, I bought some good <a href="/summaries">books</a> and found
	free courses on <a href="https://www.cybrary.it/" target="_blank">Cybrary</a>...</p>
	
	<p>
	I had everything I needed to start: a goal, hands-on exercises, and a ton of things to learn from the books and
	courses.<br>
	I started taking notes about the books and documented what I was doing in the boxes. I was doing it in Google drive,
	when I suddenly thought about regrouping everything in one place that would serve one purpose: telling my journey.
	Bonus, I would get introduced to HTML and be able to share my experience with anyone that would be interested.<br>
	This is what this site is all about.
