	<h1>About --help</h1>
	<p>Currently working as a Data scientist, I would like to shift my career path and become
	a penetration tester.<br> 
		When I decided to learn more about cybersecurity, I didn't really know
	where to start. I had very basic knowledge of how networks work, but I didn't know much about
	hacking.<br>
		A friend of mine talked to me about a course on a site called <a href="https://www.coursera.org/">Coursera</a>.
		Apparently, it consisted in building a computer and was very well rated. A few days later, we were in.
		We were not disappointed... The course was super fun and interesting 
		(you can see more <a href="https://www.nand2tetris.org/">here</a>).<br>
		I really enjoyed the fact that it was very practical and low level. It also introduced me to Coursera, where I
		would find plenty of courses on cybersecurity.

		I was very excited when I started a self-paced course costing 40$/month (the quicker you finish, the less you
		pay). I was motivated and thought I would finish it within 2-3 months.<br>
		10 months later, I was still paying for that course. I couldn't find the motivation to continue : it was too much 
		theory, not enough practice.<br> 
		I could spend hours watching videos and reading assignments, yet when I thought "what could I actually do, could I hack something, ...",
		nothing came to my mind. Furthermore, the course recommended to buy the book "TCP/IP Illustrated" by W. Richard and we
		were supposed to read a chapter each week. This is what achieved me. The course was a beginner level, but this book is
		basically the experienced network administrator's bible. I had to read each sentence several times to barely understand
		what is was talking about. I cancelled my subscription and stopped for a few months.<br>
		When my motivation came back, I decided I had to find something practical. After all, like many others, I learn best by
		doing.<br>
		After some research, I found Vulnhub and Hack The Box. I also looked for serious certifications that could help me shifting
		my carreer path and found those of Offensive Security. I was pretty much ready to go, but I still felt like I needed a little
		theory.
