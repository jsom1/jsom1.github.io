	<h1>"Hello, World!"</h1>
	<p>Welcome to my personal page. It's early 2020, and I decided to start this
		website to store everything I do related to my preparation for the 
		<a href="https://www.offensive-security.com/pwk-oscp/">OSCP</a>OSCP exam. 
		This will include : 
		<ul>
			<li>Book summaries</li>
			<li>Walkthroughs for 
		<a href="https://www.vulnhub.com/">VulnHub</a> & 
		<a href="https://www.hackthebox.eu/">Hack The Box</a> boxes</li>
			<li>Useful resources</li>
		</ul>
	
	Feel free to visit !
	</p>
	
	<p>This site focuses on my journey rather than on myself, but if you are curious,
		you can
		<a href="/about">read more about me...</a>
