	<h1>Summaries</h1>

		This page contains summaries of the books I read or am reading that help me better understanding
		the basic concepts in cybersecurity.
	</p>
	
	<p><ul><li><a href="/_summaries/">Learn how TCP/IP networks work</a><br>
		sadly, this book by Eric Lalitte is only
		available in French. I found it to be an excellent introduction to networks for beginners like myself.</li></p>
	
	<p><li><a href="/_summaries/Metasploit.md">Hacking, security and penetration testing with METASPLOIT</a><br>
		I just started the book at the time of writing. Despite the fact that Metasploit can only be used once 
		during OSCP exam, it seems that it contains many useful general information.</li></p>
