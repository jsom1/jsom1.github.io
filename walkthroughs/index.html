	<p>
		This page contains files in which I describe what I did for Hack The Box and Vulhub boxes.
		They are listed in the order in which I did them, so the first ones might contain more explanations
		and theory. Hopefully, one will see a progression throughout the boxes.<br>
		Those shouldn't be considered as walkthroughs since I am learning and not always 100% sure about what I try and write.
